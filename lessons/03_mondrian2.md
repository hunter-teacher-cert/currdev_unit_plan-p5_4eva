# Art of Code: P5.js & Computer Art
## Lesson 02 : Mondrian (Day 1)

### Main Objective:

Aim: I can use p5.js to create art using functions and parameters

### Standards:

7-8.CT.4: Write a program using functions or procedures whose names or other documentation convey their purpose within the larger task.
7-8.CT.7: Design or remix a program that uses a variable to maintain the current value of a key piece of information.
9-12.IC.7: Investigate the use of computer science in multiple fields.

### Materials/Resources:

Slides\
p5.js student accounts\
Google Classroom or other class tool to share projects and links\
Homework assignment\
Mondrian p5.js lab template\
Mondrian assessment


### Do Now: (10 min)

Think back to our previous class. What is an example of a function in p5.js? When is it helpful to use variables?

(Review of CS concepts from the previous class)


### Independent Lab (20 mins):

**Question 1**

Take out your homework assignment from last night (a Mondrian-inspired drawing). You are going to make several horizontal and vertical black or gray lines. Try to match your drawing as closely as possible.

- A. Write code that draws a thick vertical black line:
- B. Now write code for at least 2 more vertical black lines:
- C. Write code that draws a horizontal black line:
- D. Now write code for at least 2 more horizontal black lines:
  
**Question 2**  

Now you're going to add in several rectangles or squares. Start by making them black or gray. Later, you'll make them primary colors or any color of your choosing. 
  
- A. Write code that draws a black or gray rectangle:
- B. Add color! Experiment with making the rectangles different primary colors (red, yellow, blue). Write code that draws a blue, yellow, or red rectangle:
- C. What color is your rectangle? How would you change its color?
- D. Now code in several more squares or rectangles in primary colors (or other colors of your choice):

(Students will spend most of the class working independently on their sketches. When they are ready they will take the assessment.)

### Assessment: (5 min)

Mastery Check - Students will be assessed on their knowledge of the line() and rect() functions and variables (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe2fkMYNRDopvhDR-o7vtsvPsVsmHVe45TTRoFjHAXk5pMiKw/viewform)


### Closing: (5 min)

Share your Mondrian art with the class. What was the most difficult part of coding it?

(Students should be able to describe their code and how they made their sketches.)

### Homework: Handout

Start researching artists for your final project. Whose style of art would you want to recreate using p5.js?

# Art of Code: P5.js & Computer Art
## Lesson 03 : Picasso (Day 1)

### Main Objective:

Aim: Use for loops to control different design elements 

### Standards:

7-8.CT.8: Develop or remix a program that effectively combines one or more control structures for creative expression or to solve a problem.
9-12.IC.7: Investigate the use of computer science in multiple fields.


### Materials/Resources:

- Slides
- p5.js student accounts
- Google Classroom or other class tool to share projects and links
- Homework assignment
- Picasso p5.js skeleton code (https://editor.p5js.org/eric.teach/sketches/rng6hpJwI)


### Do Now: (10 min)

Launch- If you had a billion dollars and wanted to use some of it to invest in an art piece, which would you choose and why?





### Direct instruction (10 mins):

Teacher gives basic background info on Picasso

Teacher leads students on a code along with for loops

For Loop structure:

for(declare var; set limit; increment){
//code in here!
}


### Group Work: (10 mins):

Students figure out x and y values of sample for loop

### Independent Practice: (20 mins):

Students create for loop backgrounds on sample code

### Closing: (5 min)

How do we make for loops? Spicy challenge optional:


for(i = 0; i < 200; i -= 30){
   fill(i/2, 200, 100)
   ellipse(i, i, 50)
}


### Homework: 

Add a for loop to a previous design and email your teacher the code

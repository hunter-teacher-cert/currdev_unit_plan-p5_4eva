# Art of Code: P5.js & Computer Art
## Lesson 01 : Intro (Day 2)

### Main objective:

Aim: I can log in to, save and submit work using p5.js


### Standards:

9-12.DL.5: Transfer knowledge of technology in order to use new and emerging technologies on multiple platforms.\
9-12.IC.7: Investigate the use of computer science in multiple fields.


### Materials/Resources:

Slides\
p5.js student accounts\
Google Classroom or other class tool to share projects and links



### Do Now: (10 min)

What is digital art? Give a definition and an example.

See if you can come up with a new example, i.e. not something that we looked at in class yesterday.\ (Designed to get students to review material from yesterday)


### Mini-Lesson and/or Code-Along: (10 min)

Vocabulary lesson for upcoming CS terms
- A variable stores information. Variables change depending on what values you enter.
- A conditional is an if/then statement.  If “something” is true, do “this”. If “something” is false, do “that.”
- A loop is code that is repeated until a condition is met.
- A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.
> Parameters are the general variables you need for a function.
Arguments are the specific values you enter in the function.

p5.js walk through:
- Create a p5.js account
- Duplicating a Sketch
- p5.js Tips and Tricks
- Sharing Your Work

(Introduction to new CS terms and p5.js tips. Students should refer back to these slides in future lessons)

### Activities: (15 min)

First p5.js assignment:
- Create an account in p5.js
- Create a new sketch and title it
- Play around with p5.js code (use https://p5js.org/reference/ for ideas)
- When you finish, share your work with your class

(Students will create their own p5.js accounts and play around with the reference guide)

### Closing: (5 min)

Share a line of code that you wrote today. What does it do? How did you figure that out?\
(CFU that students were focused during the assignment)


### Homework: 

If students have a computer and Internet access at home they can continue exploring their p5.js accounts.

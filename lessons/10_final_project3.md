## Main objective:
Aim: I can revise my final project based on user input

## Standards:
+ **9-12.CT.9**: Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases, based on anticipating common errors and user behavior.

## In class exercises

### Do Now (5 minutes)
What are you happy about with your final project? What could be going better? Why?

### Coding Time (10 min)
Students should revisit the code they wrote yesterday, and prepare to give and receive feedback

### Peer Feedback Gallery Walk (10 min)
Students should visit 2-3 peers, run their programs, and leave feedback on their [individual feedback graphic organizers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uRuAEBR2cC578Ml_X1SHZ4ZNkHOKfyGC2QIiBHrtxbU/edit)

### Revise Code (20 minutes)
Students should implement the feedback they received

### Exit Ticket (5 minutes)
On a notecard: What are you most proud of accomplishing this unit? Why?

## Notes
Make sure to emphasize that good feedback is constructiveâ€“might be helpful to ad-lib an example of bad feedback out loud and have students point out how it can be improved.

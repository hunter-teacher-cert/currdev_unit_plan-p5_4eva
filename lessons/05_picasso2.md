# Art of Code: P5.js & Computer Art
## Lesson 04 : Picasso (Day 2)

### Main Objective:

Aim: Use for loops to control different design elements

### Standards:

7-8.CT.8: Develop or remix a program that effectively combines one or more control structures for creative expression or to solve a problem.
9-12.IC.7: Investigate the use of computer science in multiple fields.


### Materials/Resources:

- Slides
- p5.js student accounts
- Google Classroom or other class tool to share projects and links
- Homework assignment
- Picasso p5.js skeleton code (https://editor.p5js.org/eric.teach/sketches/rng6hpJwI)


### Do Now: (5 min)

Launch- Pick your favorite Picasso painting from the board and explain why you like it.


### Direct instruction (10 mins):

Teacher solicits student examples of previous projects using for loops with pre-made face

Teacher gives specific info on different Picasso styles/ periods

Teacher gives info on project requirements and reminds students how to use for loops


For Loop structure:

for(declare var; set limit; increment){
//code in here!
}


### Group Work: (10 mins):

Students discuss Picasso's different styles and create a plan for their individual projects.  Students share plans and get feedback before they are allowed to begin coding.

### Independent Practice: (30 mins):

Students create their code

### Closing: (5 min)

Who would like to share their final project?


### Homework: 

Create your own digital art project using for loops with a target audience of someone you love.  Include a 1 paragraph write up on who your audience is and why they would appreciate your piece.

# Art of Code: P5.js & Computer Art
## Lesson 02 : Mondrian (Day 1)

### Main objective:

Aim: I can use p5.js to create art using functions and parameters

### Standards:

7-8.CT.7: Design or remix a program that uses a variable to maintain the current value of a key piece of information.
9-12.IC.7: Investigate the use of computer science in multiple fields.


### Materials/Resources:

Slides\
p5.js student accounts\
Google Classroom or other class tool to share projects and links\
Homework assignment\
Teacher code along template



### Do Now: (10 min)

Go to https://p5js.org/examples/ and check out example projects, e.g. Wavemaker.

Choose one project and write down what you SEE, THINK, or WONDER about it. 

(This is an introduction to different types of projects students can make in p5.js)


### Mini-Lesson: (10 min)

Introduction to Mondrian slides:
- Piet Mondrian
- Mondrian Paintings
- Where Can We See His Artwork?
- Mondrian-Inspired Fashion

(This might be the first time many students learn the name “Mondrian” but they have likely seen art or fashion inspired by him)

### Code-Along: (15 min)
Code-along
- Create a new sketch in p5.js
- Coordinates in p5.js
- Functions in p5.js
- Drawing a line in p5.js
- Variables in p5.js
- Drawing a rectangle in p5.js
- Adding in color
- Start playing around with the editor in advance of tomorrow’s lesson

(These activities are represented in the slides and are meant to be taught as a code-along demo. There is a mix of direct instruction and student exploration.)

### Closing: (5 min)

Share a line of code that you learned how to write today. What does it do? How does it help you create a Mondrian-inspired p5.js creation?

(Students should be able to explain a line of code in their sketch.)

### Homework (handout)

In a few sentences, describe Mondrian’s artistic style to someone who has never seen his paintings.
Create your own Mondrian-inspired artwork. We will code this tomorrow in class!

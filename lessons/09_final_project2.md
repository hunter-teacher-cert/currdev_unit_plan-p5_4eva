# Lesson 09:
Final Project Day 2

## Main objective:
Aim: I can set and accomplish a goal related to my final project

## Standards:
+ **9-12.CT.4**: Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.

## In class exercises:

### Do Now (5 min):
Students will set a goal for today, based on their proposal. The goal should be specific (i.e., “I will sketch out my program, then aim to code X part of it.”, not “I will work on the program”)  

### Worktime (40 minutes)
Students will have the entire period to work on coding their program
Instructor will circulate and conference with students who need help

### Exit Ticket (5 min):
Students will reflect on whether or not they achieved their goal and why.

## Notes
You may need to give feedback on what a specific goal looks like–or even a mini-lesson! Take a look at the goals as you circulate and see how specific they are.

## Handouts
Students will continue to work off the [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yo1G15HpPLDc6-1LqWQXLAtEa51gPWYY4XGdlLe6rgs/edit) from yesterday.

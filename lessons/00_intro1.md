# Lesson 01:
Introduction to Digital Art

## Main objective:
Aim: I can create questions about digital art.

## Standards
+ **9-12.DL.2**: Communicate and work collaboratively with others using digital tools to support individual learning and contribute to the learning of others.
+ **9-12.IC.7**: Investigate the use of computer science in multiple fields.

## In class exercises

### Do Now (5 min):
On paper or digitally, students individually respond to the question: When you think of digital art, what comes to mind? Why? Students can respond with images or words!

### Activity 1: Virtual Gallery Walk (10 min)
Students take 10 minutes to view 10 works in a virtual gallery walk ([embedded in today’s slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13PCXiFJZf8Io2tiNDtRmXBCY4z6no8xuvwVackQ_E7E/edit#slide=id.g109355b3010_0_295)). They leave comments noting what they think, see, or wonder about each piece.

### Activity 2: Think-Write-Pair-Share (7-10 min)
After viewing each piece, students first independently define digital art, then share their definitions with a peer, then the class generates a shared definition of digital art, which is memorialized on a slide by the instructor.

### Activity 3: QFT (10-15 min)
Students generate questions they want to explore about digital art
Students type responses in [this shared google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mjzaC1Sw5ZvxZGF_PiTLPVKYRvqQ8l9JpmUd10vRogE/edit)
Once they generate questions, students give one another peer feedback
If time, class picks top questions they are most interested in.

### Exit Ticket (5 min):
On a notecard, students jot down 3 things they learned today, 2 things they found interesting, and one question they still have

## Notes
One thing to gauge when you do this lesson is how familiar different students are with this type of art/art-making–anyone who seems very experienced might be a helpful peer expert when making the project.

## Handouts
n/a - All work is digital unless you’d prefer to print a notecatcher for the gallery walk, rather than have students comment on the slides!

## Resources
+ Slide Deck
+ Laptops for students

**p5.js reference/documentation page:** This is a webpage that allows p5.js users to read all of the built-in functions.

**SmartBoard:** In order to present our slides and do live code-along demos, we will need a SmartBoard or other screen that connects to the teacher laptop.

**Google Slides:** We plan to use Google Slides to 

**Google Form for assessments:**

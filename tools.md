Include the names of the tools, what they do in general, how you will use them for the unit, and why you chose them.

**p5.js Editor:** This is a code editor that allows students to use the p5.js library. We plan to use this as the primary code writing platform for students because it is easy to use and allows students to see the results of their code instantaneously.

**p5.js reference/documentation page:** This is a webpage that allows p5.js users to read all of the built-in functions. We will have students use this as their primary reference point for writing code and exploring new functions. We plan to use this because it teaches students to use their resources before asking others (especially the teacher) for help.

**Adobe Color Picker:** This tool allows users to play around with different sliders to get the exact shade of any color they desire. We plan to use this for projects that involve choosing unique colors and to teach students about the RGB values.

**Laptops for students:** We want each student to have their own designated laptop so they feel like they are a part of the CS class and that the school has invested in their abilities. It is important for each and every student to feel like they are and can be a computer scientist.

**SmartBoard:** In order to present our slides and do live code-along demos, we will need a SmartBoard or other screen that connects to the teacher laptop.

**Google Slides:** We plan to use Google Slides to explain the artwork and styles of each artist and to model starter code. Most lessons will feature direct instruction using Google Slides before launching students into their work in p5.js.

**Google Form for assessments:** We plan to give students summative (and some formative) assessments using Google Forms. This is an easily accessible and gradeable tool that most students have used in the past. Because of how Google Forms autogrades, it is easy as the teacher to see common misconceptions and distractor answers.

**Google** Students will search on the Internet for further information about the artists they study in class.
